<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>My research interests are rooted in the application of engineering principles to human-centered problems.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>Safety-Constrained Shared Control</h3>
  <p>Shared control paradigms have shown substantial promise for improving human-robot collaboration. However, most work in this area focuses on scenarios where there is a known or inferred goal, and control allocation decisions are made based on task-specific metrics. This task-specific approach is not applicable in many assistive contexts where humans perform tasks in an open-ended manner and flexibility in task execution strategy is important. Task-agnostic shared control aims to provide assistance during arbitrary task execution based on safety constraints, and has the potential to support rehabilitation and training protocols that require the user to take an active role in achieving specific goals or behaviors.</p>
  <h3>Quantitative Assessment of Dynamic Reaching</h3>
  <p>Robots are powerful tools that can be used to evaluate and augment human motion, showing potential for supporting researchers and practitioners in quantifying and tracking physical impairments following injury or disease. A frequency-based assessment of motion provides greater detail than existing clinical measures, and can be used to quantify deicits in dynamic reaching ability following hemiparetic stroke.</p>
  <h3>Ball-in-Bowl Dynamic Task</h3>
  <p>To achieve effective human-robot collaboration, it is important to understand an individualâ€™s interaction bandwidth---the ability to generate motion in response to external stimuli, such as visual or haptic cuing. This becomes particularly relevant during physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), and when performing dynamic tasks that require precise timing of body motion to achieve success. A virtual task, called the ball-in-bowl, is inspired by the real-life task of carrying a glass of water without spilling. This dynamic task, paired with a robotic interface, facilitates the evaluation of interaction bandwidth during pHRI. The resonant frequency of the task can be adjusted, enabling the testing of a wide range of task frequencies corresponding to the dynamic requirements of various activities of daily living (ADLs). </p>
  <h3>Hybrid Control of Paralyzed Limbs</h3>
  <p>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons have shown promise in restoring functional reaching abilities to individuals with upper-limb paralysis. However, FES is difficult to control due to constantly changing arm dynamics, often due to muscle fatigue. On the other hand, robotic exoskeletons have large power requirements, often making them bulky and impractical for long periods of wear. To take advantage of the benefits of each method while aleviating some of their drawbacks, FES and powered exoskeletons can be combined to form a hybrid control strategy.</p>
